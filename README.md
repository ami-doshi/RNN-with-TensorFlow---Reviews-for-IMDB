# RNN-with-TensorFlow---Reviews-for-IMDB
Use Tensorflow to Design, train, and evaluate RNN Models for Reviews of IMDB Reviews

The plan is

1. Download the IMDB Reviews dataset using TensorFlow Datasets APIs
2. Count the number of unique words in the vocabulary using a tokenizer
3. Convert the words to integers so that they can be used in numerical calculations
4. Prepare your training and validation datasets using TF2.0 dataset APIs
5. Use word embeddings to convert the integers to meaningful representations i.e. feature vectors that maximize interclass similarity and minimize intraclass similarity
6. Design, train, and evaluate RNN Models: DNN
